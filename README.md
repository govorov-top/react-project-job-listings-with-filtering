# Job listings with filtering
### This is a challenge from the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt)
In this challenge, I have used Redux and React in this application, along with JavaScript, to filter out jobs based on selected categories. By incorporating Redux, I effectively managed the state of the application, while React facilitated the creation of reusable components and efficient rendering of the user interface. Additionally, I practiced working with JSON data by utilizing a local JSON file provided for this purpose.
